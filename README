Key config file:
%appdata% for windows users
~/.xdre for linux users

Savepoints:
- User: You manage everything yourself.
- Start: Saves on map start automatically, should be safe to use. You can also make your own savepoints
- Auto: Saves automatically every now and then

Bruteforce:
- separator "," | e.g 50,49,48,47,25,-50,-7
- range ":" | e.g 50:0,-25:-50
- strafe: left-to-right (-50:50 = sl50...sr50, 50:-50 = sr50...sl50)
- run: backward-to-forward
- turn: right-to-left //do not ask me why, that's just how it is
